# Wins of the Week

Once a week, come back to this file and document your "wins of the week".

Anything you consider a win counts but even better if it's a result of your progress in the Program.

## Week 01: 2021-08-16 - 2021-08-22

- I decided to take control of my Python journey and joined the PyBites Developer Mindset Program
- I added a handful of useful aliases to my shell tcsh for working with git and Python
- I dropped the tendancy I usually cling to that makes me want to perfect my
  code before I push a change, I'm learning to drop perfectionism in favor of
  rapid itteration and giving myself the freedom to develop
- setup the trello like project board and added a lot of issues to work on

## Week 02: 2021-08-23 - 2021-08-29

- I went down a rabbit hole of configuration management with Ansible and
  pulled myself out of it so I could work on high priority tasks
- I heard a great tip in one of the Code Clinics and put it to use in my
  project to close an Issue. It only took a few minutes to implement and got
  me one step closer to my goals.
- Listened to two books, Essentialism and Effortless and applied some of their
  teachings to my daily life. For instance, when randomly asked to do
  something in a conversation, I paused for five seconds, I didn't even get to
  second 3 before the person decided they would handle their issue another way
  that didn't involve me doing something for them. Awesome! Another instance,
  my manager asked me to do another project and I said yes I'm interested,
  what of these current projects do you want me to de-prioritize? He changed
  his mind and I don't have yet another project on my plate! Awesome!
- I got some much needed sleep and started a ritual before I go to bed. Here's
  what I'm doing: I aim to go to bed by 9pm, this is
  because I have a hard time falling asleep so in an effort to get more hours
  of sleep I'm going to bed early. 90 minutes before bed I get in the hottub
  and turn on an audiobook, podcast, YouTube video or mindset call. Afterwards
  I do some quick cleanup, take the dogs out then turn off my phone, take my Gorilla Dream sleep supplement, refill my water
  and hit the pillow.

## Week 03: 2021-08-30 - 2021-09-05

- I set a 90 minute goal to get some work done and by the time the alarm went
  off, I was just finishing up and ready to push my changes.
